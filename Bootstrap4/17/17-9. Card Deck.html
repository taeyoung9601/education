        <h2>Card Deck</h2>

        <p>The <code>.card-deck</code> class creates an <strong>equal height and width grid</strong> of cards.<br>The layout will <strong>automatically adjust</strong> as you insert more cards.</p>
        <p>In this example, we have added extra content to the first card, to make it ( taller ). Notice how the other cards follow.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The cards are displayed <strong>vertically</strong> on ( small ) screens ( &lt; 576px ):</p>
