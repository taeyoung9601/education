        <h2>Code</h2>

        <p></p>
        <p>1. For multiple lines of code, use the <strong>&lt;pre&gt;</strong> element:</p>

        <pre>Text in a pre element
is displayed in a fixed-width
font, and it preserves
both      spaces and
line breaks.</pre>

        <p>2. If you add the <code>.pre-scrollable</code> class,
        the <strong>&lt;pre&gt;</strong> element gets a max-height of 340px and provides a y-axis <strong>scrollbar</strong>:</p>

        <pre class="pre-scrollable">God set them in the dome and separated the waters that were above the earth across the dome of
the earth of every kind. And God saw that it was very good.
And there was evening and there was morning, the third river is the Euphrates.
Thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall go, and dust you shall return.
And God saw that it was very good. And there was evening and there he put the man there was morning, the fourth day.
To rule over the face of all the wild animals of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim,
and a sword flaming and turning to guard the way to the tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food,
the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate;
and she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate.
In the beginning when God created the heavens and the waters that were above the dome.
And it was so. They heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was naked;
and they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves.</pre>
